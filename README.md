# Introduction 
Re::CNN is a complete from-scratch implementation of Convolutional Neural 
Networks built entirely in C++/CUDA without using any high-level deep learning 
frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.). The project demonstrates: 
- Pure C++/CUDA Implementation: Every component is hand-coded, from 
basic matrix operations to complex backpropagation algorithms, using only 
standard C++ libraries and minimal dependencies. 
- Modular Architecture: Clean separation of concerns with distinct 
components: Layers, Base Classes, Neural Network, Activation Functions.
- High-Performance Computing: Matrix operations for convolution and backpropagation. 
Moreover, they support for CUDA acceleration (configurable in build system). 
- Educational Deep Dive: Complete transparency into CNN internals, 
making every mathematical operation visible and understandable.
